The actions available are liquidity provision, leveraged trading, collateral supliment, NFT buying. 1. Liquidity provision: A liquidity pool is a pair of tokens, where users deposit equal values of both tokens to create a market for those tokens. These pools enable trading between the token pairs without the need for an order book or a centralized counterparty. There are multiple benefits associated with liquidity provision, for example, you can collect Liquidity Provider fees. 2. Leveraged trading: kind of trading which enables you to trade with loaned capital, increasing your position size. 3. Collateral suppliment: some DeFi protocols allow you to lock some of your assets on their platforms, using it as a collateral, and take a loan, secured by the collateral. 4. NFT buying: You can buy and sell various NFTs on NFT marketplaces.",

The actions available are liquidity provision, leveraged trading, collateral supliment, NFT buying. 1. Liquidity provision: A liquidity pool is a pair of tokens, where users deposit equal values of both tokens to create a market for those tokens. These pools enable trading between the token pairs without the need for an order book or a centralized counterparty. There are multiple benefits associated with liquidity provision, for example, you can collect Liquidity Provider fees. 2. Leveraged trading: kind of trading which enables you to trade with loaned capital, increasing your position size. 3. Collateral suppliment: some DeFi protocols allow you to lock some of your assets on their platforms, using it as a collateral, and take a loan, secured by the collateral. 4. NFT buying: You can buy and sell various NFTs on NFT marketplaces.",
